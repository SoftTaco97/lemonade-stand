# Lemonade Stand

This is a revamp of an old project I did for a competition at work. 

Original project can be found [here](https://codepen.io/SoftTaco79/pen/BOxmYw)

The purpose of this project is to learn more about the [Vue Material component library](https://vuematerial.io/), as well as learn even more about the [Vue.js framework](https://vuejs.org/).
